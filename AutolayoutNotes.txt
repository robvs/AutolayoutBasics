IN GENERAL
- Minimize number of constraints (for clarity & maintainability)
- Generally constrain elements relative to what's around it
	- i.e. If a label sits above a text field, make the text field's top constraint relative to the lable, not the top of the superview
- Do not assume a specific screen width or height
- Constraints can have an outlet
- Identifiers can be assigned to constraints in Interface Builder; this helps w/debugging


LABELS
- No need for height constraint
- Clear "Explicit" checkbox for prefered width
- If it will never wrap, no need for width or trailing constraint
- If # of lines may vary, set # of lines to 0
- Hiding a label does not set its dimensions to 0. To do that, set its text to an empty string

IMAGES
- If not fixed dimensions
	- Set width (or height) relative to something else
	- Set aspect ratio constraint
		- If aspect never changes, set in storyboard
		- If aspect may change, set in code based on image's actual dimensions
